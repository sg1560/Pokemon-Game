I used the professor's code to work on this assignment. I didn't modify any of his files (Makefile, etc.). This code randomly generates maps when you move to a different location in the world. If you go to a location already visited,
the map is the same. Additionally, the probability of the pokemarts and centers decreases as you travel farther away from the center. Finally, all maps on the edge of the world don't have gates to exit out of the world. You can therefore travel to any location in the world but never out; and the game gets harder and harder as you travel farther and farther due to the scarcity of the pokemarts and centers. All the requirements of the project are met.
