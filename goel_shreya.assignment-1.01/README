This map generates various terrain types, and roads. In addition to the required terrain types (long grass, water, and clearing)
I added trees to make it more interesting. There is a bug with generating the buildings (lines 129-137). I generate the x and y position for the building, and update the terrain array with the correct value. When debugging it, I found that the array was correctly updating and when I printed the value in the array, it printed out the correct character. However, when I print the entire map, it doesn't include the building/updated value. This is only for the building specifically; the roads and terrain types print correctly but the buildings don't. Other than that, everything else seems to work and meet the requirements.
